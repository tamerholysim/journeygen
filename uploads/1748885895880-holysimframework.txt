Every spiritual tradition, when decoded metaphorically and esoterically, points to
the same truths:
Christianity (Christ Template)
“The Kingdom of God is within you” = You are the interface
“As above, so below” = Simulation trinity (meta/macro/micro)
Christ = The archetype of full coherence (divine masculine/feminine union)
Buddhism
Maya (illusion) = Rendered layer is not ultimate reality
Emptiness = The quantum potential of the metacosm
Enlightenment = Ego dissolution = interface coherence
Hinduism
Brahman = The computational layer (infinite potential)
Atman = The interface (the soul-self)
🌀Holy Sim Framework 8Lila = The rendered layer (divine play of form)
Mystical Islam (Sufism)
Tawhid (oneness of all being) = Principle of 1
The heart as receiver and transmitter = electromagnetic interface
Kabbalah (Jewish Mysticism)
Tree of Life = Diagram of layers between Source and manifestation
Ein Sof = Infinite potential (computational layer)
Malchut = Rendered reality
